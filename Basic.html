        Pakistan, populous and multiethnic country of South Asia.
         Having a predominately Indo-Iranian speaking population,
        Pakistan has historically and culturally been associated with its neighbours Iran, Afghanistan, and India.
         Since Pakistan and India achieved independence in 1947.
         Pakistan has been distinguished from its larger southeastern neighbour by its overwhelmingly,
          Muslim population (as opposed to the predominance of Hindus in India).
         Pakistan has struggled throughout its existence to attain political stability and sustained social development.
        Its capital is Islamabad, in the foothills of the Himalayas in the northern part of the country,
        and its largest city is Karachi, in the south on the coast of the Arabian Sea.

        Pakistan was brought into being at the time of the partition of British India,
         in response to the demands of Islamic nationalists.
          as articulated by the All India Muslim League under the leadership of Mohammed Ali Jinnah, 
          India’s Muslims would receive just representation only in their own country. From independence until 1971,
           Pakistan (both de facto and in law consisted of two regions—West Pakistan, 
           in the Indus River basin in the northwestern portion of the Indian subcontinent, 
           and East Pakistan, located more than 1,000 miles (1,600 km) to the east in the vast delta of the Ganges-Brahmaputra river system. 
           In response to grave internal political problems that erupted in civil war in 1971,
            East Pakistan was proclaimed the independent country of Bangladesh.</b></p></dd>

           <dt><h3> <sup>(1)</sup>Sindh</h3></dt> 
               <dd> <p><b>
                    Sindh pronounced  is one of the four provinces of Pakistan, 
                    in the southeast of the country, and the historical home of the Sindhi people.Sindh is the third largest province of Pakistan by area, 
                    and second largest province by population after Punjab. Sindh is bordered by Balochistan province to the west, and Punjab province to the
                     north. Sindh also borders the Indian states of Gujarat and Rajasthan to the east, and Arabian Sea to the south. Sindh's landscape consists 
                     mostly of alluvial plains flanking the Indus River, the Thar desert in the eastern portion of the province closest to the border with India
                      the Kirthar Mountains in the western part of Sindh.

                    Sindh has Pakistan's second largest economy, while its provincial capital Karachi is Pakistan's largest city and financial hub, and hosts
                     the headquarters of several multinational banks. Sindh is home to a large portion of Pakistan's industrial sector and contains two of
                      Pakistan's commercial seaports, Port Bin Qasim and the Karachi Port. The remainder of Sindh has an agriculture based economy, and produces
                       fruit, food consumer items, and vegetables for the consumption of other parts of the country.
                    
                    Sindh is known for its distinct culture which is strongly influenced by Sufism, an important marker of Sindhi identity for both Hindus
                     Sindh has Pakistan's highest percentage of Hindu residents and Muslims in the province.Several important Sufi shrines are located throughout 
                     the province which attract millions of annual devotees.
                    
                    Sindh's capital, Karachi, is Pakistan's most ethnically diverse city, with Muhajirs, or descendants of those who migrated to Pakistan 
                    from India after 1947 and throughout the 1950s and 1960s, making up the majority of the population. Sindh is home to two UNESCO World
                     Heritage Sites – the Historical Monuments at Makli, and the Archaeological Ruins at Mohenjodaro.</b></p></dd>

          <dd> <p> <b> Punjab, province of eastern Pakistan. It is bordered by the Indian state of Jammu and Kashmir to the northeast, the Indian states of Punjab and Rajasthan to the east, Sindh province to the south, Balochistān and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa provinces to the west, and Islamabad federal capital area and Azad Kashmir to the north. The provincial capital, Lahore, is located in the east-central region, near the border with India. The name Punjab means “five waters,” or “five rivers,” and signifies the land drained by the Jhelum, Chenab, Ravi, Beas, and Sutlej rivers, which are tributaries of the Indus River. Punjab is Pakistan’s second largest province, after Balochistān, and the most densely populated. Area 79,284 square miles (205,345 square km). Pop. (2011 est.) 91,379,615.

                Urban civilization existed in the Indus River valley from about 2500 to 1500 BCE, when, it is believed, Aryan incursions
                 brought it to an end. The area entered recorded history with the annexation of Punjab and Sindh to the Persian empire by
                  Darius I (c. 518 BCE). The founder of the Maurya dynasty, Chandragupta, incorporated the region into his Indian empire 
                  about 322 BCE. The first Muslims to penetrate northern India were the Arabs, who in 712 CE conquered the lower Punjab.
                   The rest of the Punjab was conquered (1007–27) by Maḥmūd of Ghazna. The area subsequently came under various other Muslim
                    rulers until the victorious entry of the Mughals in 1526. Under the Mughals the province enjoyed peace and prosperity for
                     more than 200 years. Their power declined after 1738, however, and in 1747 Lahore fell under weak Afghan rule marked by 
                     lawlessness and disorder. The religious sect called the Sikhs rose to power in the latter part of the 18th century. The
                      Punjab came under British occupation in 1849, after the British victory over the Sikhs in the battles of Chilianwala and 
                      Gujrat. When the Indian subcontinent received its independence in 1947, Punjab was split between Pakistan and India,
                       with the larger western portion becoming part of Pakistan. The present provincial boundaries were established in 1970.
                Punjab’s area mostly consists of an alluvial plain formed by the southward-flowing Indus River and its four major tributaries
                 in Pakistan, the Jhelum, Chenab, Ravi, and Sutlej rivers. The general slope of the land is from northeast to southwest, but
                  it rises in the areas between rivers. The alluvial plain has a diversity of landforms: its active floodplains are flooded
                   every rainy season and contain changing river channels, while meander floodplains lying adjacent to the active floodplain
                    are marked by relict and abandoned channels. In the northern parts of the province are the Murree and Rawalpindi and the 
                    Pabbi hills, part of the Sub-Himalayas, and in the far north is the Potwar Plateau. Although the region is a traditional
                     floodplain, the extraordinary flooding of the Indus River in the summer of 2010 was especially disastrous in Punjab,
                      where millions of people were affected (by some estimates, one-half of all Pakistanis affected were in Punjab).The 
                      government’s failure to alert the public of the impending disaster elicited much criticism; some felt that officials, 
                      having had previous experience handling flooding there, should have been able to provide Punjabis with more forewarning.

            <dt><h3><sup>(3)</sup>Balochistan</h3></dt>
           <dd><p><b>Balochistanis one of the four provinces of Pakistan. It is the largest province in terms of land area, forming the 
                southwestern region of the country, but is the least populated. Its provincial capital and largest city is Quetta.

                Balochistan shares borders with Punjab and the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa to the northeast, Sindh to the east and southeast,
                 the Arabian Sea to the south, Iran to the west and Afghanistan to the north and northwest.
                
                The main ethnic groups in the province are the Baloch people and the Pashtuns, who constitute 52% and 36% of the 
                population respectively (according to the preliminary 2011 census). The remaining 12% comprises smaller communities 
                of Brahuis, Hazaras along with other settlers such as Sindhis, Punjabis, Uzbeks and Turkmens. The name "Balochistan"
                 means "the land of the Baloch". Largely underdeveloped, its provincial economy is dominated by natural resources,
                  especially its natural gas fields, estimated to have sufficient capacity to supply Pakistan's demands over the medium 
                  to long term. Aside from Quetta, the second-largest city of the province is Turbat in the south, while another area of
                   major economic importance is Gwadar Port on the Arabian Sea.
                 Balochistan is noted for its unique culture and extremely dry desert climate.</b></p></dd> 
           <dt> <h3><sup>(4)</sup> <abbr title="Khyber Pakhtunkhwa">KPK</abbr> </h3></dt>
          <dd>  <p><b>Khyber Pakhtunkhwa  formerly known as the North-West Frontier Province NWF is one of the four administrative provinces of Pakistan,
                 located in the northwestern region of the country along the international border with Afghanistan.

                It was previously known as the North-West Frontier Province until 2010 when the name was changed to Khyber Pakhtunkhwa by the 18th
                 Amendment to Pakistan's Constitution and is known colloquially by various other names. Khyber Pakhtunkhwa is the third-largest province 
                 of Pakistan by the size of both population and economy, though it is geographically the smallest of four. Within Pakistan, Khyber
                  Pakhtunkhwa shares a border with Punjab, Balochistan, Azad Kashmir, Gilgit-Baltistan and Islamabad. It is home to 17.9% of Pakistan's
                   total population, with the majority of the province's inhabitants being Pashtuns and Hindko speakers.
                
                The province is the site of the ancient kingdom Gandhara, including the ruins of its capital Pushkalavati near modern-day Charsadda. 
                Originally a stronghold of Buddhism, the history of the region was characterized by frequent invasions under various Empires due to 
                its geographical proximity to the Khyber Pass.[citation needed]
                
                Since the 9/11 attacks in the United States in 2001, the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa has been a major theatre of militancy and terrorism which
                 intensified when the Taliban began an unsuccessful attempt to seize the control of the province in 2004. With the launch of Operation
                  Zarb-e-Azb against the Taliban insurgency, the casualty and crime rates in the country as a whole dropped by 40.0% as compared to 2011–13,
                  with even greater drops noted in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and the Federally Administered Tribal Areas.[5] As of July 2014, about 929,859 people
                   were reported to be internally displaced from North Waziristan to Khyber Pakhtunkhwa as a result of Operation Zarb-e-Azb.
    
                On March 2, 2017, the Government of Pakistan considered a proposal to merge the Federally Administered Tribal Areas with Khyber
                 Pakhtunkhwa, and to repeal the Frontier Crimes Regulations, which are currently applicable to the tribal areas. However, some political
                  parties have opposed the merger, and called for the tribal areas to instead become a separate province of Pakistan.On 24 May 2018,
                   the National Assembly of Pakistan voted in favour of an amendment to the Constitution of Pakistan to merge the Federally Administered 
                   Tribal Areas with Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province. The Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Assembly then approved the historic FATA-KP merger bill
                    on 28 May 2018 making FATA officially part
                 of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa,[11] which was then signed by President Mamnoon Hussain, completing the process of this historic merger.</b></p></dd>

           <h3><sup>(5)</sup>  Gilgit-Baltistan</h3></dt> 
           <dd> <p><b>Gilgit-Baltistan , formerly known as the Northern Areas, is a region administered by Pakistan as an administrative territory,
                 and constituting the northern portion of the larger Kashmir region which has been the subject of a dispute between India and Pakistan since
                 1947, and between India and China from somewhat later.[9] It is the northernmost territory administered by Pakistan.[1] It borders Azad 
                 Kashmir to the south, the province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa to the west, the Wakhan Corridor of Afghanistan to the north, the Xinjiang region
                  of China, to the east and northeast, and the Indian-administered union territories Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh to the southeast.

                Gilgit-Baltistan is part of the greater Kashmir region, which is the subject of a long-running conflict between Pakistan and India.
                 The territory shares a border with Azad Kashmir, together with which it is referred to by the United Nations and other international
                  organisations as "Pakistan administered Kashmir".[1][note 1] Gilgit-Baltistan is six times the size of Azad Kashmir.[14] The territory
                   also borders Indian-administered union territories Jammu and Kashmir (union territory) and Ladakh to the south and is separated from 
                   it by the Line of Control, the de facto border between India and Pakistan.
                 The territory of present-day Gilgit-Baltistan became a separate administrative unit in 1970 under the name "Northern Areas".
                 It was formed by the amalgamation of the former Gilgit Agency, the Baltistan district and several small former princely states,
                the larger of which being Hunza and Nagar.[15] In 2009, it was granted limited autonomy and renamed to Gilgit-Baltistan via the
                Self-Governance Order signed by President of Pakistan Asif Ali Zardari, which also aimed to empower the people of Gilgit-Baltistan.
                 However, scholars state that the real power rests with the governor and not with chief minister or elected assembly.
                 The population of Gilgit-Baltistan wants to be merged into Pakistan as a separate fifth province and opposes integration with 
                 Kashmir.[18][19] The Pakistani government has rejected Gilgit-Baltistani calls for integration with Pakistan on the grounds 
                that it would jeopardise its demands for the whole Kashmir issue to be resolved according to UN resolutions.</b></p></dd>
