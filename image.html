    <h3> <u>
        What is Makli ?</u></h3>
    
        <dt><h4>(1)Location</h4></dt>

        <p><b>
<dd>
        The site is located on the outskirts of Thatta.
        Makli Necropolis is located in the town of Makli, 
        which is located on a plateau approximately 6 kilometres
         from the city of Thatta,[1] the capital of lower Sindh until
          the 17th century.[4] It lies approximately 98 km east of Karachi,
           near the apex of the Indus River Delta in southeastern Sindh. The 
           southernmost point of the site is
         approximately 5 miles north of the ruins of the medieval Kallankot Fort.</dd></b></p>
         



         <dt><h4>(2)Etymology</h4></dt>

 <p> <b><dd>    
The site, and nearby hills, are said to derive their
name from a legend in which a Hajj pilgrim stopped at 
the site and erupted into spiritual ecstasy, declaring
 the site to be Makkah for him. The Sufi saint Sheikh Hamad 
 Jamali is then said to have named the site "Makli",
 or "Little Makkah", after hearing the story of the pilgrim.</dd></b>  </p>  
<dt><h4>(3)History</h4></dt>
<p><b><dd>The Sufi saint, poet and scholar Shaikh Jamali established a
     khanqah, or Sufi gathering site, 
     at Makli and was eventually buried there.
      The 14th century Trakhan ruler, Jam Tamachi,
       venerated the saint and wished to be interred near the saint, 
       beginning the tradition of using Makli as a funerary site.
    The site rose to prominence as a major funerary site during under 
    the rule of the Samma dynasty, who had made their capital near Thatta.
    The most architecturally significant tombs at the site date from around
     the time of the Mughal era, between 1570 and 1640 CE.</dd></b></p>









<dt><h4>(4)Layout</h4></dt>
<p><b><dd>
    Makli Necropolis occupies 10 square kilometres,
     housing at least 500,000 tombs. It stretches
      from Pir Patho at the southern end of the Makli Hills, 
      northward in a roughly diamond shape.[6] Its eastern edge
       is formed by the Makli Hills ridge. The largest monuments 
       are generally found
     at the southern edge of the site, though the Samma tombs are
      found in the north.</dd></b></p>
<dt><h4> (5)Royal mausolea</h4></dt>
<p><b><dd>

    Some mausolea feature strong architectural influences from Central Asia.
    The impressive royal mausolea are divided into two major clusters: those from the
     Samma period form their own cluster,
     while those from the Tarkhan, Arghun, and Mughals periods are clustered together.
      Samma cluster
    Tombs dating from the Samma Dynasty are clustered together in a 5 acre section at 
    the northern end of the necropolis. The Samma were Rajput princes, who seized control
     of Thatta in 1335.[5] Samma tombs are strongly influenced by Gujarati styles, and 
     incorporate Muslim and Hindu decorative elements.
      Jam Nizamuddin II's tomb features a
     jharoka that displays Gujarati influences.
    The tomb of the King Jam Nizamuddin II, completed 
    in 1510, is an impressive square structure measuring 11.4 metres on each side. 
    It was built of sandstone and decorated with floral and geometric medallions.
     The cuboid shape of the tomb may be inspired
     by the Ka'aba in Makkah. Its dome was never built, thus leaving the interior
      exposed to the elements.The monument features a large and intricately
       carved Gujarati-style jharoka, or balcony, and a small peak atop it, which 
       make the tomb resemble a temple. The exterior features 14 bands of decorative
        motifs that feature both Quranic verses and Hindu symbols,[5] though in 
        keeping with Islamic tradition, all decoration takes the form of geometric 
        patterns, with the sole exception of a frieze depicting local ducks.
    
    The tomb of Jam Nizamuddin's adoptive son, Darya Khan, 
    resembles a Rajasthani fort, and was built after his death in 1521 Darya Khan had
     been born a slave, but rose to prominence as a general after defeating an Arghun
      army in battle. He was granted the title "Hero of Sindh," and was eventually made
       Madrul Muham, or Prime Minister.
    
    Arghun, Trakhan, and Mughal cluster
    The tomb of Isa Khan Tarkhan I, who ruled from 1554 to 1565,
     represents a departure from the funerary architecture of the
      Sammas. The tomb features a distinctly new cenotaph-style, and is laid out in a 
      rectangular shape with its inner walls entirely covered with Quranic verses. The
       tomb also has an area dedicated for the graves of 5 of his royal ladies.
    
    
    The tomb of Isa Khan Hussain II is one of the most notable
     monuments at the site.
    The mausoleum of Isa Khan Hussain II Tarkhan (d. 1651) features a two-story stone
     building with cupolas and balconies. The tomb is said to have been built during Isa's
      lifetime. Upon completion, legend states that Isa ordered the hands of the craftsmen 
      to be cut off so that they would not be able to make another monument to rival his own.
    The tomb of Mirzaa Baqi Uzbek features a Central Asian style iwan.
    The tomb of Jan Beg Tarkhan (d. 1600), is an octagonal brick structure
     whose dome is covered in blue and turquoise glazed tiles. Pavilion or 
     canopy tombs chattri maqbara or umbrella tomb are another typical Indo-Islamic
      architectural feature, as well as enclosure tombs.
    The Mughul period is represented by many tombs on the southern side
     of the necropolis, including the mausoleum of Mirza Jani and Mirza Ghazi Baig, that of Nawab Shurfa Khan, the enclosure of Mirza Baqi Baig Uzbek and of Mirza Jan Baba as well as the impressive restored tomb of Nawab Isa Khan Tarkhan the Younger.</dd></b></p>
